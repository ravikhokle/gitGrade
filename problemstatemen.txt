UnsaidTalks
GitGrade Hackathon
Theme:AI + Code Analysis + Developer Profiling
Problem Statement:
You are tasked with creating an intelligent system that can evaluate a student’s GitHub
repository and convert it into a meaningful Score + Summary + Personalized Roadmap.
In today’s tech world, a GitHub repository is a developer’s tangible work but most
students don’t know how good, clean, or complete their code looks to a recruiter or
mentor.
Your challenge is to design a system that:
1. Accepts a GitHub Repository URL as Input
The user will paste a link to any public repository they want analyzed.
2. Automatically Fetches Repository Data
Your system must gather publicly available details such as:
● Number of files and folder structure
● Code quality indicators (e.g., linting, complexity)
● README & documentation quality
● Test coverage (if present)
● Commit history & contribution consistency
● Language / tech stack usage
● Real-world applicability of the project
● Use of version control best practices (branches, PRs)
3. Evaluates the Repository on Multiple Dimensions
Your system should analyze the repo to judge:
● Code quality & readability
● Project structure & organization
● Documentation & clarity
● Test coverage & maintainability
● Real-world relevance & usefulness
● Commit & development consistency
4. Generates Three Key Outputs:
UnsaidTalks
A. Score / Rating
Example formats:
● 0–100
● Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
● Bronze / Silver / Gold
B. Written Summary
A short evaluation describing the repository’s current quality.
Example:
“Code structure is clean and consistent, but documentation and tests need improvement.”
C. Personalized Roadmap
Actionable steps the student must follow, such as:
● Improve folder structure
● Add README.md with project overview and instructions
● Write unit / integration tests
● Follow Git best practices (branches, PRs, commits)
● Add CI/CD pipelines
● Optimize code for readability and maintainability
This roadmap should feel like guidance from an AI coding mentor.
Goal of the Problem:
The goal is to build a “Repository Mirror”, a system that reflects the real strengths and
weaknesses of a project based entirely on its GitHub repository.
Your solution should prioritize:
● Accuracy
(Make reasonable judgments based on real repository data.)
● Honest Feedback
(Tell students exactly what’s strong and what needs work.
● Actionable Improvement
(A roadmap they can immediately follow.)
This challenge is not about marks, theory, or memorization. It’s about evaluating a
developer’s practical coding output.
Sample Input/Output Examples
Example 1
UnsaidTalks
Input:
https://github.com/rahul-dev-ai/todo-app
Output:
Score: 78 / 100
Summary: Strong code consistency and folder structure; needs more tests and
documentation.
Roadmap:
● Add unit tests

● Introduce CI/CD using GitHub Actions
Example 2
Input:
https://github.com/sneha-codes/weather-dashboard
Output:
Score: 42 / 100
Summary: Basic project structure but poor documentation and inconsistent commits.
Roadmap:
● Add README with setup instructions
● Restructure folders
● Commit regularly with meaningful messages
Example 3
Input:
https://github.com/manish-projects/ecommerce-site
Output:
Score: 91 / 100
Summary: Excellent project depth and clean codebase.
Roadmap:
● Add automated tests
● Improve issue tracking
● Contribute project to open-source
Submission Guidelines:
Participants must submit a GitHub Repository Link containing:
● Source Code
